# Portfolio-landing-page

This is a landing page for a Portfolio website that I made using majorly HTML and CSS. The page does lack in responsive design and there was also room for some animations, all of which I'll improve in my next project.
I just wanted to get my hand on HTML and CSS with this mini-project.

I took the reference from https://sandip-portfoliojs.netlify.app and mostly copied the text material from there itself.
